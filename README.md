# All Shades of Blue: An Atom Syntax Theme for (Markdown) Prose Writers

_Note: This theme requires burodepeper's [Markdown Grammar](https://atom.io/packages/language-markdown) package._

This is an [Atom](https://atom.io) theme that addresses my own preferences for writing Markdown-based prose. In particular it:

* Indents lists, gives list indicators a blue hue, and differentiates list text color from body text color;
* Uses a light font weight;
* Bolds headings; and
* presents a blue-on-blue font/background combination for block quote elements.

This style _mostly_ adheres to my preferences for writing, but there are more changes I want to make (especially after I write with this theme for a while). Currently, I've only looked at this for Markdown; I'll work on other syntaxes as I need to. But it was difficult to find a Markdown-based syntax theme that worked for me, so this is an attempt to solve the problem in a way that best meets my needs and preferences.
