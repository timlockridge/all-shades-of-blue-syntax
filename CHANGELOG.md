## 0.5.3
* Added critic markup highlighting.

## 0.5.2
* Updated blockquote background color to an rgba value. The opacity allows me to see selection and spelling errors.
* Fixed negative margin inheritance issue on markdown links in lists

## 0.5.0
* Updated color for folding text handles. I may be the only person who ever runs into this problem, but Folding Text for Atom is a great outliner, and visible handles are helpful!
* Updated the readme, as I realized this theme uses the class selectors from burodepeper's Markdown grammar package.
* Updated the changelog. This is a helpful exercise in narrating revisions.

## 0.4.0
* Turns out, gray lists don't make for the most readable text. Changed.
* Disabled the red error highlighting of ampersands in Markdown files. I use a lot of ampersands in my drafts, and I understand character encoding. No error highlighting needed.

## 0.3.0
* Updated json keywords. (Again, not my finest versioning moment.)

## 0.2.0
* Updated readme. (Note to self: Bundle these changes. No need for an incremental version here.)

## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Hello world.
